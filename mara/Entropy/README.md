# Entropy
MVP: 
   * Input weekly budget
   * input what was spent on a daily basis
   * Get current total and final total.
   * See what remains.
   * Restarts on monday
   * Using textual


Goals:
* create a simple and clean UI
* create logic for the rest and how it shows up.
  * budget can't be edited once put it.
  * textual layout
  * Resolution Collapse when user gets to low. it will make the interface lower.


Reason:
   * Most budget apps are bloated and fat. They take up too much space.
   * Categories are a distraction. kill them
   * No auto collect, makes you passive and not active
